# guidernas-guide

This is my exam project done in January 2024. It explores what it is
like creating a fullstack app.

Next.js, React, tailwindcss and daisyUI for frontend and Java and
Springboot with a MySQL server for the backend. 



### Installation

This project requires Docker to containerize and run both 
backend and frontend in composition with `docker-compose`

To install docker globally on your computer

```
npm i -g docker
```

Then clone the repo with `git clone` to your computer 

---

### Running the application

In the root folder run: 

`DB_PASSWORD=root docker-compose up --build` 

Then access the application on http://localhost:3000
